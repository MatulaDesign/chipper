# Chipper Docs

#### It is important that you pick a proper tool for the job, and however Chipper supports local async actions, it **DOES NOT** replace proper external async tools like [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) or [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr), so please you these to carry out querrying the vast emptiness of the interwebs.<br>

Chipper's async capabilities exist mostly for querrying internal APIs of the devices you run your apps on.<br>
My local async needs usually cover grabbing some built-in API's response (eg. local storage) in react-native or using client APIs created by your cloud services provider (eg. Firebase authentication).<br>
I always have to write some weird hooks to properly handle these smaller async actions and then pass their responses to my state. Chipper handles these local async actions and integrates it smoothly with your state.

Chipper is a tool (pun intended), not a library or a plugin. It is an input/output device that takes your data and either updates selected subscribed components or it tells you why it didn't. So, the original data shape can never be overwritten and Chipper will tell you about it (without updating and possibly breaking the UI).
My recommendation is to use Chipper when you know what your data shape is and you know you won't need to overwrite it with some new data.

I intend for these docs to be as thorough as possible, but expect some minor things not being mentioned here, because I simply didn't think about them at the moment of writing.

[Chipper demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/chipper-demo-tgi65)

## Chipper elements

The tool consists of four exported elements: [Chipper](#1-chipper), [ChipperConveyor](#3-chipperconveyor), [useChip](#2-usechip) and [useChipper](#4-usechipper).
You don't have to use hooks, because state can be accessed from outside of react components. It won't be reactive though, so no re-rendering logic to keep everything in check.

### 1) `Chipper`

First, let's set up the initial store (you can omit this step):

```javascript
import Chipper from '@lumberyard/chipper';

Chipper.loadChips([
  ['user', { uid: '12345', name: 'piglet' }],
  ['theme', { dark: true, color: 'pink' }],
  ['friends', { joey: "how you doin'?" }],
]);

// or you can add bits of state from anywhere you like outside of
Chipper.loadChips([['user', { uid: '12345', name: 'piglet' }]]);
// or in a component
Chipper.loadChips([['theme', { dark: true, color: 'pink' }]]);
```

As you can see, we pass an array of tuples to a `loadChips()` method. We do that, because we inform Chipper about possible subscribcions the store is built on top of a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) object (why rewrite something that works great out of the box, right?)<br>

You can go commando and use `Chipper`'s methods to read and set up the store yourself from somewhere random and/or outside of React using side effects of `queryChips()` method. You don't have to use `loadChips()` to populate the state, however it takes precedence over other methods. Just keep in mind that `set()` methods used across this plugin either overwrite existing state or create a new one.

```javascript
import Chipper from '@lumberyard/chipper';

// add to Chipper somewhere in your code
Chipper.queryChips('user', { uid: '12345', name: 'piglet' });

// or
Chipper.queryChips('user').set({ uid: '12345', name: 'piglet' });

// or if for some reason you want to change one chip from another chip
Chipper.queryChips('theme').get(); // { dark: true, color: "pink" }
Chipper.queryChips('user').set({ dark: false, color: 'purple' }, 'theme'); // notice the second argument "theme"
Chipper.queryChips('theme').get(); // { dark: false, color: "purple" }

// grab default from Chipper somewhere else in your code
Chipper.queryChips('user').get(); // { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }

// or if you want to grab some chip's state from another chip
Chipper.queryChips('user').get('theme'); // { dark: false, color: "purple" }
```

**Note:** These are some of the building blocks of Chipper's hooks.<br>
I had a case of having to update state outside of React once, so I wanted to make sure I'll have an easy way of adding data from wherever, whenever.

### 2) `useChip`

If you work with React/React-Native do yourself a favor and `useChip`. It's easier that way.<br>
`useChip` handles re-rendering and subscription to state of matching components that use it.<br>
This hook works directly with `Chipper` class instance exported from the plugin. Just keep that in mind, when you create your [own Chipper's instances](#3-chipperconveyor`).

#### a) read

Use `data` and/or `status` props from the returned object to read the chip.<br>
`data` can be changed by you, `status` is handled by the plugin:

```javascript
import { useChip } from '@lumberyard/chipper';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, status } = useChip('user');

  console.log(data); // { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }
  console.log(status); // { type: "IDLE", message: undefined }

  return (...)
}
```

#### b) write

You can use `useChip` itself to add data to your state by passing something as a second argument. If the chip with given key exists, the second argument is ignored, because `loadChips()` takes precedence.

```javascript
const user = useChip('user', { details: 'redacted' }).get().data; // { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" };

const chips = useChip('eatChips', { better: 'not' }).get().data; // { better: 'not' };
```

Please be advised that Chipper does not let you change the data shape. If you created a chip somewhere earlier in your code, the `set()` method will `console.error` if you try to change the data scheme.

```javascript
Chipper.queryChips("user", { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" });

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { set } = useChip('user');

  set("it's a prank bro!") // console.error(`Chipper: You're trying to change data shape`);

  return (...)
}
```

I decided to weld some doors shut, to enforce consistency in the code. I figured, since we're playing with data, we have to make sure it doesn't play us.

`useChip` gives you a bunch of ways to add data to your state:

```javascript
import { useChip } from '@lumberyard/chipper';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { set } = useChip('user');

  // using primitives to change data
  set('hello world');

  // using selectors to change data
  set((draft) => {
    draft.uid = 'new_uid';
  });

  // using mocked primitives to change data and status
  set('hello world', { timeout: 2000 }); // this handles changes to chip's status and sets chip's data after 2 seconds

  // using mocked selectors to change data and status
  set((draft) => {
    draft.uid = 'new_uid';
  }, { timeout: 2000 });

  // using async to change data and status (timeout is ignored)
  set(Promise(...));

  return (...)
}
```

#### c) meddle

`useChip` also introduces `api` property with access to some lower level `Chipper` methods. You can go naughty and put your hands on state of other chips from here. This re-renders all components subscribed to the piece of state that's being changed.<br>
Please be advised that `api.set()` is similar to `set()` method: it'll inform you when you try to overwrite an existing chip's data scheme.

```javascript
import { useChip } from '@lumberyard/chipper';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { api } = useChip('user');

  api.set({ dark: false, color: "purple" }) // updates 'user' data
  api.set({ dark: false, color: "purple" }, "theme") // updates 'theme' data
  api.get() // grabs data and status from 'user' state
  api.get('theme') // grabs data and status from 'theme' state
  api.cut() // removes 'user' state
  api.cut('theme') // removes 'theme' state

  return (...)
}
```

### 3) `ChipperConveyor`

`Chipper` is an instance of `ChipperConveyor` class. `Chipper` is a global singleton that can be accessed using `useChip` hook. In case you want to create your own singleton that will exist only for specific element in your code, you can import `ChipperConveyor` and use `useChipper` to access this secluded data. Have a look at `Chipper`

```javascript
// my-secluded-state.js
import { ChipperConveyor } from '@lumberyard/chipper';

export const FruitBasket = new ChipperConveyor();

FruitBasket.loadChips([
  ['apple', { shiny: true, poisoned: 'definitely not' }],
  ['pear', { shape: 'pear-ly', tastes: 'poor-ly' }],
]);
```

### 4) `useChipper`

This hook will work with both `Chipper` and `ChipperConveyor`. It is `useChip` on steroids, with the exact same API.

```javascript
// somewhere in your code
import Chipper, { ChipperConveyor, useChipper } from "@lumberyard/chipper";

import { FruitBasket } from './my-secluded-state';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const apple = useChipper(FruitBasket, 'apple');
  const user = useChipper(Chipper, 'user');
  const tomato = useChipper(FruitBasket, 'tomato');
  const banana = useChipper(FruitBasket, 'banana', { curvature: '90deg');

  console.log(apple.data) // { shiny: true, poisoned: "definitely not" }
  console.log(user.data) // { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }
  console.log(tomato.data) // console.error(`Chipper: chip "tomato" doesn't exist`)
  console.log(banana.data) // { curvature: '90deg' }

  return (...)
}
```

## Chipper API

Chipper's store consists of smaller pieces of state called "chips".
Chips are objects...

```javascript
const chip = {
  data: {...},
  status: { type: '...', message: '...'}
}
```

... stored inside a `Map()` instance like so: `Map().set('key', chip)`

### 1) `Chipper`/`ChipperConveyor` props

- #### `loadChips(queue: IQueue): void`

  This method loads data into Chipper. It takes the tuple's second item (value/data) and turns it into a `chip` that gets stored inside `Map()` instance

  ```javascript
  Chipper.loadChips([['user', { uid: '12345', name: 'piglet' }]]);
  ```

- #### `queryChips(key: string, data: IData): IQuery`

  This method returns an object:

  - `get(k?: string): IChip`
  - `set(data: IData | IChip, k?: string): void`
  - `cut(k?: string): boolean`

  These are low level methods, that let you read and write Chipper's state:<br>
  a) `queryChips('user').get()` - you can either pass no argument (Chipper will use the default key from `queryChips()` method) or you can pass a string to grab a matching chip<br>

  ```javascript
  api.get(); // grabs data and status from 'user' state
  api.get('theme'); // grabs data and status from 'theme' state
  ```

  b) `queryChips('user').set(data)` - requires either plain data or a `chip` object. If non-chip-shaped-object is passed, Chipper turns it into a `chip` to handle status changes. It also takes a string as a second argument, which lets you direct Chipper onto other chips<br>

  ```javascript
  api.set({ dark: false, color: 'purple' }); // updates 'user' data
  api.set({ dark: false, color: 'purple' }, 'theme'); // updates 'theme' data
  ```

  c) `queryChips('user').cut()` - similar to `.get()`, but removes the chip

  ```javascript
  api.cut(); // removes 'user' state
  api.cut('theme'); // removes 'theme' state
  ```

- #### `chips: Map<string, IChip>[]`

  Chips is a Map object storing the state.

- #### `enqueue(key: string, update: IUpdater): void`

  This method adds updated data to Chipper's queue (or subscribes to state, if you will).
  In case of Chipper, `update` argument that we pass here is derived from `React.useState()`'s dispatch, but you could throw in here whatever value, if you want to reuse the logic for something else.

  ```javascript
  Chipper.enqueue(key, updater);
  ```

- #### `dequeue(update: IUpdater): void`

  This method removes subscription to state.

  ```javascript
  Chipper.dequeue(updater);
  ```

- #### `convey(key: string, chip: IChip): void`

  This method updates all interested chips.

  ```javascript
  Chipper.convey(key, chip);
  ```

- #### `queue: IQue[]`

  Queue is an array of updated values that we use to pinpoint which components should be updated.

### 2) `useChip`/`useChipper` props

- #### `data: T = IData`
- #### `status: IStatus`

  `status` is an object...

  ```javascript
  status: {
    type: "IDLE" | "LOADING" | "ERROR" | "SUCCESS",
    message: Error | string | undefined,
  }
  ```

  ...that will be modified internally by the plugin if you use the hook's `set()` method either with an async function passed as data or with `timeout` option for "regular" data. Chipper [doesn't give you methods\*](<#api-chipper.queryChips()>) to update the `status` manually.

- #### `set: (update: IUpdate, options?: IOptions): void`

  `set` is a mighty method that handles adding sync/async data to your state. It integrates easily with the rest of the tools available in Chipper.<br>
  Async actions run with `useChip`'s `set` method are handled by a javascript generator function to make sure there are no memory leaks when/if the component unmounts before the function finishes.

  Here's a list of ways you can write data to your state:

  a) primitive set:

  ```javascript
  set(7);
  set('hello world');
  set({ something: { anything: 'We are potato' } });
  ```

  b) immerised selector set:

  ```javascript
  set((draft) => {
    draft.something.anything = 'I am potato';
  });

  set(({ something }) => {
    something.anything = 'I am potato';
  });

  set(() => 'why not?');
  ```

  c) mocked/async'd set:<br>

  ```javascript
  set(7, { timeout: 1234 });

  set(
    ({ something }) => {
      something.anything = "I am potato";
    },
    { timeout: 1234 }
  );

  set(Promise(...));
  ```

  d) `set` lets you pass an `options` object as a second argument. `options` introduces some nifty callbacks:

  - `timeout: number`<br>
    mocks async for simple data before it gets written to state
  - `onInit: () => void`<br>
    this is run at the beginning of every async call and `status.type = 'LOADING'` is set here
  - `onError: (error: IError) => void`<br>
    runs on error and returns the error value. Also `status.type = 'ERROR'` and `status.message = error` are set here
  - `onSuccess: (resp: T) => void`<br>
    if all goes well, this callback will return the data after it's been written to state and `status.type = 'SUCCESS'` is set here
  - `wrapResp?: (...args: any[]) => T`<br>
    this bit wraps around the response and lets you edit it before it gets written to state

  `options` add a lot of flexibility to your code:

  ```javascript
  set(Promise(...), {
    timeout: 1234 // in case of promises/async timeout is ommited
    wrapResp: JSON.stringify,
    onInit: () => console.log('init'),
    onError: (error) => console.log('error', error),
    onSuccess: (resp) => console.log('resp', resp),
  });

  // or you can do
  const { api } = useChip('user');
  set(({ something }) => {
    something.anything = "I am potato";
  }, {
    timeout: 1234 // since plain data is being passed, the timeout applies
    wrapResp: JSON.stringify,
    onInit: () => {
      const persistSomething = api.get("theme");
      LocalStorage.set('key', persistSomething);
      componentRef.current = persistSomething;
    },
    onSuccess: (resp) => api.set(resp, "theme"), // we can update some other chips with the response
  })
  ```

- #### `api: Chipper.queryChips()`

  The `api` property is taken 1:1 from `queryChips()` method used in `Chipper` class, however, since it's used inside `useChip`, it informs other components about changes made to their state so they can re-render and update properly.

  **TIP:** Technically, you can use `api`'s `set` property to set `status` of every piece of state, but you HAVE TO pass a `chip` (not just plain data) as a first argument. This might come in handy if you wanna kick some other subscribed component into `LOADING` state

  ```javascript
  const { data, api } = useChip('user');

  const chip = {
    data: data || api.get('theme').data,
    status: { type: 'LOADING' },
  };

  api.set(chip, 'theme'); // this will do nothing to the component that runs it, but will update into "LOADING" state all other components subscribed to "theme" chip
  ```

  **NOTE:** I recommend this approach only if you know what you're doing, because passing incorrect data using this method will fuck shit up.
